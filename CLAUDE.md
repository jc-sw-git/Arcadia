# Arcadia — working notes for Claude

Arcadia is a game launcher that unites all other launchers: one tab per launcher, Big Picture
mode fully controllable by gamepad (incl. Steam Controller), desktop mode by mouse/keyboard.
The repo was formerly "SteamButler" (Rust); that code lives in `legacy/steambutler-rs/` as a
reference for porting (binary VDF codec, scanner ideas, architecture notes).

- **Designs (source of truth for UI):** https://claude.ai/artifact/8A9qxc67RcsuFmavaqCAuN
  (artboards: library, detail page, search, artwork modal, Spotify, launcher settings,
  localization, appearance, Big Picture settings, desktop mode). Read it before building UI.
- **Open work:** GitHub issues (label `roadmap`). Roadmap #26 → one epic per area (`type:epic`)
  → tasks, all linked as GitHub sub-issues. Add new issues as a sub-issue of the matching epic
  (`gh api -X POST repos/jc-sw-git/Arcadia/issues/<epic>/sub_issues -F sub_issue_id=<issue id, not number>`).
  Features are `type:story` and start with a `> **Story:**` line. See `docs/roadmap.md`.
- **Refinement first:** before implementing an issue (Iteration 1) or an epic (from Iteration 2), refine
  it with the owner using the skill `.claude/skills/refinement`; rules in `docs/roadmap.md` → Refinement.
- **Language:** the owner writes German; UI texts are German for now (localization is an issue).
  Code, comments and commit messages are English.

## Build, test, run

```bash
dotnet build Arcadia.slnx
dotnet test Arcadia.slnx
dotnet run --project src/Arcadia.App -- --demo        # demo libraries for all launchers
```

- .NET 10 SDK. `Directory.Build.props` sets `TreatWarningsAsErrors` — keep the build warning-free.
- A running Arcadia locks `bin/` → close it before building: `Get-Process Arcadia | % { $_.CloseMainWindow() }`
  (CloseMainWindow, not Stop-Process: Arcadia must shut SISR down cleanly).
- Logs: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Arcadia\logs\arcadia.log` (keys, gamepad buttons, SISR start/stop),
  `sisr.log` (SISR's own log, overwritten per start). Settings: `%APPDATA%\Arcadia\settings.json`.
- Crashes before the first log line (e.g. XAML/style errors) only show in the Windows event log:
  `Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='Application'; StartTime=(Get-Date).AddMinutes(-5)} | ? ProviderName -match '.NET Runtime'`.

## Releases

- Windows x64 only for now. Installer and self-update with **Velopack**: `tools/release/Pack.ps1 -Version x.y.z`
  publishes self-contained and runs `vpk pack` → `artifacts/releases/Arcadia-win-Setup.exe` + update feed.
  Installs without admin rights to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Arcadia\current\Arcadia.exe` (the logs folder next to it
  survives updates). The `Velopack` package and the `vpk` tool (`.config/dotnet-tools.json`) share one version.
- `VelopackApp.Build()…Run()` must stay the first thing in `Program.Main`. Uninstalling asks (20 s, default
  no — Velopack kills the hook after 30 s) whether SISR, VIIPER and usbip-win2 go too (`ControllerSupportRemoval`).
- `ArcadiaUpdateService` checks GitHub Releases (stable only) every 6 h and on "Nach Updates suchen" in
  Einstellungen → "Über Arcadia". "Jetzt aktualisieren" shows only with an update; it downloads, Arcadia closes
  and Velopack installs silently (no input needed) and restarts it. Updating while a game runs is fine: SISR
  keeps running across the restart (the new Arcadia adopts it), pauses for running games are handed over with
  `--sisr-paused-for <dir>`, and `--background` brings the window back behind the game instead of in front.
  "Was ist neu" lists the bullets of every release body between the running and the newest version
  (`Changelog`). Push a tag `vX.Y.Z` to release (`release.yml`).
- Versioning (owner's rule): SemVer, 0.x until the first full release 1.0. Major may break; minor adds only
  non-breaking features; patch only fixes bugs — no features, no intended behaviour change (security aside).
  This matters because third-party plugins are planned.

## Verifying UI changes

Tests cover Core/Launchers/ControllerSupport logic, not the UI. For UI changes, run the app and
look at it — see the skill `.claude/skills/arcadia-verify/SKILL.md` and the scripts in
`tools/dev/` (screenshot with key presses, foreground tracing, XInput probe, Steam shortcuts).
The owner often tests manually at the same time — say before driving the app with keys.

For bugs that aren't obvious from the code, or a fix that didn't hold, use the skill
`.claude/skills/diagnose` (a check that goes red on the bug comes before any hypothesis).

## Definition of Done

A change (PR) is done when all of this holds. Every feature iteration ends with a code review
issue (e.g. #66) that checks the whole milestone again, then a manual test on the release
candidate; this list keeps both small. Larger review findings become `type:tech-debt` issues at
the start of the next feature iteration. Process and test plan format: `docs/testplans/README.md`.

- **Builds and tests:** `dotnet build` without warnings, `dotnet test` green, CI green on all platforms.
  New logic in Core/Launchers/Input/ControllerSupport comes with tests, error paths included.
- **Robust:** no exception can end Arcadia. No unguarded `async void` or fire-and-forget task;
  unexpected errors are logged with stack trace to `arcadia.log` and shown as a toast.
  Network and process waits have a timeout.
- **Secure:** no user- or file-supplied string goes unchecked into a process start, path or URI;
  downloads are verified; no secrets or personal data in logs; admin rights only where unavoidable.
- **Controller first:** every new flow works with a gamepad alone (no mouse/keyboard), B goes back.
  Anything that can't (e.g. UAC) is named in the PR.
- **Readable:** names say what things are; methods do one thing; comments explain *why*, not *what*.
  A developer new to the code understands the change from the diff and `CLAUDE.md`.
- **Modular:** launcher-specific code stays in its launcher folder; UI and Core don't special-case launchers.
  A launcher is one `ILauncherIntegration`, registered in `BuiltInLaunchers`; built-in launchers use only
  `Arcadia.Launchers.Abstractions`, as a plugin would.
- **Themeable:** no colour, brush or shadow values in views or styles; they are resources in
  `Theme/Theme.axaml`, so a theme (later possibly a plugin) can replace them all in one place.
- **Verified for real:** UI, input, launcher and Steam Controller changes were run and looked at
  (`.claude/skills/arcadia-verify`); what was only checked mechanically is said so.
- **Docs current:** `CLAUDE.md` / `docs/` updated when a fact, rule or workflow changed.
- **Test plan:** a PR that closes an issue adds that issue's manual tests to
  `docs/testplans/iteration-<n>.md` (IDs `T<issue>-<n>`, each marked `E2E: ja/nein`) and records
  the test runs done during implementation with their real environment. If nothing new needs a
  manual test (e.g. a refactoring of features already covered by tests), the issue's section
  says so in one line with the reason. The `Testplan` CI check fails without the section.
- **Performant:** no blocking work on the UI thread; code on a hot path (start, scan, library,
  input, running in the background beside a game) stays within the budgets below, measured when touched.

Budgets (Release build, owner's PC): start to usable library < 2 s with 1,000 games; gamepad
input to visible focus move < 50 ms; idle CPU < 1 % with gamepad polling; < 400 MB RAM with
5,000 games; a rescan never blocks the UI; no measurable cost to a running game.

**When criteria conflict**, the higher one wins: 1. security and privacy, 2. robustness and data
safety, 3. controller first, 4. performance, 5. readability and maintainability, 6. modularity and
scalability. Performance beats readability only when a measurement breaks a budget. A conflict
decided on purpose is named in the PR (and in the review issue).

**Iterations:** feature iteration N (milestone "Iteration N": issues → code review incl. a
retrospective of the processes (keep, change or drop each) → manual test → release), then acceptance iteration N (milestone "Abnahme Iteration N": every `E2E: ja`
test case of N becomes an automated acceptance test in CI). Feature iteration N+1 starts only
when acceptance iteration N is closed, so a change in N+1 that breaks a feature of N shows at once.

## Layout

| Project | Content |
|---|---|
| `src/Arcadia.Launchers.Abstractions` | What a launcher is made of, with no dependency on the rest: `ILauncherIntegration` (scanner, optional client and install monitor, `Locate`), `ILauncherScanner`, `ILauncherClient`, `IInstallMonitor`, models (`Game`, `LauncherInfo`, `LaunchTarget`). The future plugin interface for launchers |
| `src/Arcadia.Core` | `LauncherRegistry` (the registered launchers; reads see only the enabled ones), `KnownLaunchers`, `GameSorter`, `PageSizes`/`PageWindow`, `SearchQuery`, `AppSettings`/`SettingsStore`, `LibraryService`/`LibraryRefresher` (scan and rescan), `InstallTracker` (installs started from Arcadia or in the launcher), `Changelog` (release notes between versions) |
| `src/Arcadia.Launchers` | `BuiltInLaunchers` (the one place a launcher is registered), integrations (`SteamIntegration`, `EpicIntegration`, `DemoIntegration`), Epic scanner, catalog, log reader, client and install monitor, `DirectLauncherClient`, `GameLaunchService`, `ProcessWatch`, Steam (`SteamScanner`, `SteamInstallMonitor`, `SteamContentLog`, `SteamLoginLog`, `TextVdf`, `BinaryVdf`, `SteamShortcuts`, `SteamInstallation`) |
| `src/Arcadia.Input` | `XInputGamepadSource` (polls 4 slots, auto-repeat for D-pad/stick) |
| `src/Arcadia.ControllerSupport` | Steam Controller Support: `SisrHost` (`ISisrHost`), `SisrApiClient`, `UsbipDriver`, `UsbipPorts`, `GitHubReleases`, `ControllerSupportService` (`SisrState`), `ControllerSupportPlatform` (Windows/Steam, replaced in tests), `ControllerSupportRemoval` (uninstall) |
| `src/Arcadia.App` | Avalonia 12 UI (MVVM, CommunityToolkit.Mvvm 8.4 partial properties), `Theme/Theme.axaml`, `Views/MainWindow.axaml`, `ArcadiaUpdateService` (Velopack). `MainViewModel` holds navigation and wires the parts; `StatusBarViewModel` (header) and `ToastViewModel` are its children |
| `tests/Arcadia.Core.Tests` | xUnit |

Big Picture UI is laid out at 1920×1080 inside a `Viewbox`. Focus/navigation is done in the
view models (`MainViewModel.Handle(UiAction)`), not with Avalonia focus: buttons are
`Focusable=False`, keys are handled in a tunnelling `KeyDown` handler.

## Rules that are easy to get wrong

**Product decisions** (agreed with the owner; don't change without asking):
- Page sizes 10/25/50/100, default 25. A size is selectable if the library has *more* games
  than the next smaller size (`PageSizes.IsAllowed`).
- Sorting: name / install date / last played, each ascending or descending; games without a
  date always last.
- One "Ansicht" modal (Y) for sort + page size. X = search (all launchers, on-screen keyboard,
  `/steam-epic term` prefix, keyword per launcher), R3 = keyboard layout switch, Menu/☰ or
  right click = context menu. No "all launchers" tab. No dedicated favourite button.
- Dependent options sit in the same box as their main switch.
- If an update is available, A still says "Spielen" and starts the game; the launcher installs the update
  first. The update shows as an icon, and the detail page says below the button that the launcher may update
  first (owner, 2026-10-12). Launchers have no update-only command: Steam ignores `steam://install` for
  installed games and `steam://validate` verifies every file first; Playnite offers no update action either.

**Errors:** a game start goes through `GameLaunchService.TryStartAsync`, which never throws. Work nobody awaits
(timer handlers, `Task`s started from sync code) runs through `AppErrors.Guard`/`.Forget(context)`: unexpected
errors land with stack trace in `arcadia.log` and as a toast. No `_ = SomethingAsync()` in the App.

**Avalonia 12:**
- A locally set property (e.g. `Fill="…"`, `Stroke="…"`) beats any style — state colours must
  come entirely from styles (`Classes.x="{Binding …}"` + `Style Selector="….x"`).
- `RenderTransform` can't be animated with key frames → give the element its own
  `<RotateTransform/>` and animate `RotateTransform.Angle` (see `Path.spinner`).
- `SystemDecorations` is now `WindowDecorations`. Box shadows of `Button.plain` go on the
  template part: `Button.x /template/ Border#Chrome`.
- Fluent's `Button` and `ItemsControl` clip to their bounds, so an outer focus ring (BoxShadow) is cut off;
  `Theme.axaml` sets `ClipToBounds=False` on both. A focus ring also needs room in clipping parents
  (`ScrollViewer` padding). With several BoxShadows, the later one paints on top.
- Compiled bindings: every `DataTemplate` needs `x:DataType`; reach the window's view model
  from inside a template with `$parent[Window].((vm:MainViewModel)DataContext).Prop`.

**Launcher and controller findings** (verified on the owner's PC; read the matching file before
touching that code, and add new findings there, not here):
- Steam library, installs, updates, `shortcuts.vdf`: `docs/launchers/steam.md`
- Epic launcher, catalog, install monitor, playtime: `docs/launchers/epic.md`
- Steam Controller Support (SISR, usbip-win2, focus handling): `docs/controller-support.md`

## Git

- Commit and push to feature branches freely; never push to `main`. Changes reach `main` only through a PR
  that the owner reviews and merges.
- Branch names: `{prefix}/{issue-title}-{issue-number}` in kebab case, e.g. `fix/steam-scanner-crash-42`; without
  an issue, drop the number. Prefixes: `feat` (new or changed feature behaviour), `fix` (bug fix), `ci` (CI only),
  `test` (tests only), `doc` (docs only, agent skills included), `td` (any other product code change, i.e. tech
  debt). Rename generated names such as `claude/project-thread-…` before the first push.
- **Never** end commit messages with a `Co-Authored-By` trailer.
- Commit messages: English, imperative subject, body explains why.
- Opening a PR needs no prior OK (tell the owner the link). Merging, tags/releases, closing issues and posting
  comments only on the owner's explicit word.
